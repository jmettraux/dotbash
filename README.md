# dotbash

My .bashrc and .bash_profile

Nothing spectacular.

I tend to do
```
cd
git clone git://github.com/jmettraux/dotbash .bash
ln -s .bash/bashrc .bashrc
ln -s .bash/bash_profile .bash_profile
. .bashrc
```
to get started on a system.


## license

MIT if it's worth it.

Note that the git prompt code under `_prompt` comes from somewhere... I can't remember where and I can't indicate the original license, not give credit where it's due. Sorry.
